summary: The gourd on the right was purchased in Nanjing in 2018. After years of careful handling, it has shed its woody exterior. Now, when tapped, it emits a crisp, porcelain-like sound. The surface of the gourd has become smooth and shiny, akin to a mirror, where one can discern a reflection. Drawing from my woodworking course, I applied the proportional techniques learned in using a lathe to craft a wooden gourd, complete with its base.

In the journey of collecting and appreciating objects, there are some that evolve with us, becoming more than just possessions—they become narratives of transformation. One such artifact in my collection is the gourd on the right, a relic of a trip to Nanjing in the year 2018.

When it first came into my possession, it exuded an earthy, wooden charm. Over the years, as I handled it with care and curiosity, I witnessed a remarkable metamorphosis. The once-coarse exterior gave way to a refined elegance. A gentle tap now produces a clear, resonant note, reminiscent of delicate porcelain. It's as if the gourd has shed its former self to reveal a newfound sophistication.

The tactile experience has transformed as well. What was once rugged to the touch has now become a surface of sleek luminance. It gleams like a polished mirror, capable of reflecting the visage of those who peer into its glossy embrace. It's a testament to the power of time and interaction, an ode to the alchemy of human touch.

In my pursuit of craftsmanship, I delved into the intricacies of woodworking. The art of using a lathe, in particular, captured my imagination. It was with a sense of reverence for this gourd's journey that I embarked on a project. Using the principles of proportionality, I set to work, fashioning a wooden counterpart to the gourd.

The process was a labor of love, a dance of hands and tools guided by a reverence for the natural form. The result, while echoing the gourd's silhouette, bore the unmistakable imprint of human craftsmanship. It stood as a tribute to the transformative power of time and touch, a companion piece to the gourd's narrative of evolution.

In this dual representation—the gourd and its wooden counterpart—I found a tangible reminder of the dynamic interplay between nature and human intervention. It was a testament to the enduring spirit of craftsmanship, where the past converges with the present to shape the artifacts of our lives. The gourd, now a vessel of memories, stood as a symbol of the potential for beauty that lies within the passage of time.
