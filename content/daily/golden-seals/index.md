summary: The image demonstrates a new sealing technique I've been experimenting with. By utilizing the natural stickiness of the seal ink, while it's still wet, I evenly sprinkle golden metallic powder. This gives the seal a striking, shimmering gold effect that catches the eye. On the left side of the image is my personal name seal, while on the right is the pen name I use.
