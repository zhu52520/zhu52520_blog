summary: The picture showcases my environment for practicing calligraphy. Typically, there would be tea, items to fiddle with, and music as companions. In this cozy setting, I can wholeheartedly immerse myself in the emulation and practice of calligraphic works. The script demonstrated in the picture is Xiaozhuan, a font established during the Qin Dynasty, often extensively employed in seals.
