summary: For the practice sheets used in my calligraphy exercises, I choose to keep them all. Once I accumulate a certain amount, I personally bind these practice sheets into a booklet using hole-punching, threading, and crafting a cover, complete with date annotations. This allows me to vividly track the progress and changes in my calligraphy practice over time.
