summary: Water chestnuts are a common ingredient on dining tables in the Jiangnan region of China. Their powdery flesh lies hidden beneath a tough, black shell, making them a favorite among food enthusiasts. However, the sharp, claw-like exterior of the water chestnut actually makes it an excellent material for crafting hand strings. With careful handling, the water chestnut transforms into a glossy black, and even though its sharp edges can prick the palm, it remains a cherished item.
