summary: The picture displays my partial emulation of the "Preface to the Holy Teaching of the Tang Dynasty Tripitaka Master." The original author of this post is Wang Xizhi, a renowned calligrapher from the Chinese Tang Dynasty. The script used is semi-cursive script, a style that accelerates writing speed with the addition of a small number of connected strokes while still maintaining a certain level of neatness.
