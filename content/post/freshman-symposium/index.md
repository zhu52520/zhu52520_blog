Dear classmates,

In this golden autumn, you step into the halls of the School of Information Science and Technology at ShanghaiTech University, carrying dreams and holding hopes. To help you better understand the EE major and the field of electronic engineering, we have specially prepared an exciting symposium for you, hoping to inspire and guide you.

This symposium invites professors and senior students who will share their insights, experiences, and stories from their studies and research. You will have the opportunity to engage in face-to-face discussions with professors and seniors, gaining a deeper understanding of the essence and cutting-edge science within the EE major and the field of electronic engineering.

We look forward to your participation! Let's navigate through the challenges and sail through the waves together in the sea of learning!
