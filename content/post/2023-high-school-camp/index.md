From August 21st to August 27th, 2023, the School of Information Science and Technology at the ShanghaiTech University held its first High School Science and Technology Camp, inviting outstanding students from the Second Affiliated High School of East China Normal University. Through diverse activities such as small-scale, focused topic practices, interactive discussions, laboratory visits, and lectures by professors, the camp aimed to cultivate students' autonomous learning methods, broaden their horizons, deepen their understanding of information science and related disciplines, and lay a foundation for their advancement to higher levels of learning.

To build upon the campers' foundational knowledge, this science and technology camp, drawing on topics from the National University Electronic Design Contest, guided students in the systematic design and validation of a "paper counter." This endeavor aimed to develop students' knowledge in various areas such as digital and analog circuits, integrated circuits, power electronics, embedded systems, computer programming, and more. After a week of practical application, students combined theory with hands-on experience, fine-tuning the system's accuracy (single-sheet detection), ensuring the overall robustness of the system.
