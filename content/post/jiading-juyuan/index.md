"The story of the Double Ninth Festival told by the grandparents was really wonderful, and it taught me a lot. Today, I am going to tell a story for my grandparents too. The name of the story is 'The Argument at Grandpa Dictionary's Home'..."

On the evening of October 12th, laughter filled the Jiating Welfare Institute. The 'Time-Honored Tales' reading event was being held here in the Chuyuan New District. Listening to centenarians talk about the Double Ninth Festival, performing for the elderly, sharing Double Ninth cakes, and more—seven special reporters from the Chuyuan New District Cultural Activity Center presented their own performances and interview topics in advance, offering heartfelt holiday greetings to the grandparents in the welfare institute.

## Savoring Traditional Culture Through Listening

As the saying goes, the elderly are treasures. Their rich experiences are valuable assets to us. This event fully engaged the enthusiasm of the elderly, allowing them to introduce the younger generation to the origins and customs of the Double Ninth Festival. For instance, how to make delicious Double Ninth cakes and the significance of eating them—all these piqued the children's interest and broadened their horizons. The elderly were visibly delighted at the event, eagerly opening up to share stories. Staff member Xiaojin proudly introduced the elderly to the young reporters: 'The grandparents in our welfare institute are all quite old. They love chatting with children. With the arrival of young reporters today, they are especially active.' The children, in turn, were attentive, enjoying the stories while leaning in close to their grandparents. Grandma Niyun, 104 years old, the oldest in the welfare institute, had a particularly engaging conversation with 6-year-old Ren Zeming, who happily remarked, 'Listening to Grandma Niyun's stories about the Double Ninth Festival, I feel like I've learned a lot of knowledge that I couldn't find in books. It feels really interesting.'

## Passing on the Virtue of Respecting the Elderly Through Contribution

Respecting and honoring the elderly is a traditional virtue in our country, one that should start from children. During the event, the children showcased their talents. Magic tricks by Xiaoyu Xuan, brain teasers by Rui Bo, and other fantastic performances earned rounds of applause from the elderly, bringing joy to them. 'Seeing the children, we feel much younger and very happy,' said 86-year-old Wufengying cheerfully. As an active participant here, whether singing or dancing, she puts in her best effort. Today was no exception; besides sharing Double Ninth Festival stories, she also danced Yangko (a traditional Chinese dance) on the spot, overflowing with happiness. The 'Little Story King' Wang Zhen, skilled at storytelling, enthusiastically engaged with 'Grandpa Bao,' 84 years old, sharing the latest good news. 'Grandpa Bao,' who loves reading newspapers and books, patted his 89-year-old beloved, Zheng Zhaojuan, and affectionately said, 'Little girl, are you happy today? It's so lively.' Observing this heartwarming scene, Wang Zhen's mother sighed, 'It's really meaningful to bring children to the welfare institute for the Double Ninth Festival. It's like a lively lesson in virtue for us parents.'

## Self-Growth Through Exercise

It is understood that the Chuyuan New District's 'Time-Honored Tales' reading activities are closely linked to traditional festivals. Allowing children to participate as special reporters not only helps them understand the charm of traditional culture but also creates a comprehensive stage for them to showcase and exercise themselves, thus gaining more growth opportunities. Additionally, the event emphasizes the concept of contribution, instilling in children from an early age a sense of dedication and gratitude. This plays an undeniable role in their personal growth. The organizers mentioned that the effectiveness of the event at the scene is one aspect that tests the quality of the activity—whether the participants have gained something. This is equally important. After this event, each child received a special task: to write a personal reflection on the activity and share it with everyone. Undoubtedly, this gives them more opportunities for exercise and growth."
