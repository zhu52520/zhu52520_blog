Encouraging undergraduates to enter the laboratory and engage in cutting-edge scientific research is a major feature of undergraduate education at ShanghaiTech University. This innovative training model continues to yield positive results. Recently, three papers authored by undergraduate students from Professor Liu Yu's research group at the Smart Grid Science Center of the School of Information Science and Technology at ShanghaiTech University have been accepted for presentation at the Power and Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM) organized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). These studies focus on the principles of relay protection and fault location in power systems, aiming to ensure the safe and stable operation of new types of power systems with large-scale renewable energy integration. PESGM, hosted by the IEEE Power & Energy Society, stands as the largest and most prestigious international academic conference in the field of power systems.

## Principles of Power Network Fault Localization based on Voltage Amplitude Measurement and Sparse Estimation

Accurately identifying fault segments and determining fault locations in large-scale power networks play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability of power supply. Existing methods rely on installing synchronized phasor measurement units at some network nodes to achieve fault localization. However, these units require satellite clock synchronization and are limited in number in current power networks. To address this, researchers have proposed a power network fault localization method based on local voltage amplitude measurements. Considering the distributed parameter of transmission lines, the measurement phase is introduced as an additional unknown in fault localization, fully utilizing the sparsity characteristics of the equivalent injected fault current to establish a novel principle for fault localization. This approach, while compatible with voltage amplitude measurements, maintains the accuracy of the localization results. The research findings were published under the title "Power Network Fault Location Based on Voltage Magnitude Measurements and Sparse Estimation." Zhu Yuxuan, an undergraduate student from the School of Information Science and Technology's 2020 class, served as the first author, Professor Liu Yu as the corresponding author, and ShanghaiTech University as the primary affiliation.
