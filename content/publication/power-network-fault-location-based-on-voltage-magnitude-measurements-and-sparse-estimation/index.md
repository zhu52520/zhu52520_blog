  In this paper, an improved fault location method based on magnitude
  measurements of voltages and sparse estimation is proposed for power networks.
  Compared to existing sparse estimation based fault location methods, the
  proposed method not only retains the advantages of sparse estimation, but also
  avoids the complexity of PMU installation. In this paper, the influence of
  fault current on the bus voltages is equivalently represented by the bus
  injection currents at terminals of the faulted line. With only the voltage
  magnitude measurements, the FISTA algorithm is adjusted to match the
  characteristics of the sparse estimation problem and is applied to solve for
  fault location. Extensive numerical experiments with different fault types,
  impedances and locations prove that the proposed method can accurately
  determine the faulted line section with a large power network, and presents
  high fault location accuracy within the faulted line section using only
  voltage magnitude measurements at a limited number of buses.
