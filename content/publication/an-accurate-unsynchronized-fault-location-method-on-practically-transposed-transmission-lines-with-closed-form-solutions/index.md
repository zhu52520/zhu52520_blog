  This paper proposes an unsynchronized two-terminal fault location method on three phase practically transposed
  transmission lines.
  Compared to the existing fault location methods, the proposed method considers the asymmetry of the
  practically transposed transmission lines during the fault in practice. First, the proposed method constructs the
  practically transposed transmission lines by connecting three untransposed transmission line sections. For each
  section, the fully distributed parameters line model is adopted to ensure the modeling accuracy. According to the
  physical laws that the line should obey, the unsynchronized angle is estimated with analytical formulation before
  the fault. Next, the closed-form solutions of fault location are derived for different fault events, to avoid the risks
  of unconvergence using the iterative algorithms. In the numerical experiments, the proposed method shows
  higher accuracy of fault location than the existing fault location methods, regardless of fault types, locations and
  impedances. The proposed method also demonstrates robustness against various unsynchronized angles, loading
  conditions, measurement noises and line lengths.
