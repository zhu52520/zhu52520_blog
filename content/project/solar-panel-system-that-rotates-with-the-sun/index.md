Design the light intensity comparison circuit and corresponding algorithm based on photoresistor;

Draw the schematic diagram and PCB of the solar panel voltage regulator circuit;

Use 3D printing to make the mounting bracket of the photoresistor;

Build the system based on two servos to achieve any angle of rotation;

Improved code to allow the solar panel to automatically adjust after rotating to an extreme angle.
