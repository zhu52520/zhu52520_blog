Completed the theoretical derivation of the differential equation satisfied by the electromagnetic wave injected from the coaxial line with a known dielectric constant into the coaxial line with an unknown dielectric constant;

Used MATLAB to solve the relationship between the unknown dielectric constant and the projection and reflection coefficients;

Verified the correctness of the theory by CST simulation.
