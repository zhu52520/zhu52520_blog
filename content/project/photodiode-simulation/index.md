Reproduced a three-layer mesa structure photodiode based on the given paper and simulated its electric field distribution;

Quantitatively analyzed the electric field distribution in each semiconductor layer;

Speculated the change in the electric field while actually absorbing the photon based on existing photoelectric theories.
