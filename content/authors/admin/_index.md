Yuxuan Zhu is an undergraduate student at ShanghaiTech University, majoring in Electronic Engineering. On campus, he has completed my academic life to a high standard and is the TOP 1 student with the GPA > 3.9/4.0 in the EE major. At the same time, he served as an undergraduate research assistant at the TALENT and PSPAL laboratories. Off campus, he concurrently serves as a teaching assistant for multiple courses. In addition, he enjoys his life, especially by introducing some traditional Chinese lifestyle habits into it.
