            * Explored how to use limited measurement information to locate faults in power networks;
            * Researched new algorithms to enable fault location after the measurement devices in the power grid lose time synchronization;
            * Completed extensive numerical experiments with different fault types, impedances, and locations to prove the accuracy of the proposed method;
            * Transformed the power system with renewable energy;
            * Improved existing methods to enable fault location for power grids with new energy sources.
